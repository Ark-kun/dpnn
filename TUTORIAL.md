## Lateral Connections in Denoising Autoencoders Support Supervised Learning

In this tutorial we will understand how to implement ladder network as explained in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08215.pdf). In this paper the authors have shown how unsupervised learning using a denoising autoencoder with lateral connections help improve the classification accuracy in supervised learning.
